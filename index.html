      So, the '$' symbol means 'jQuery'.  Its magic.

        // called 'keys' and the other called 'code'.  The one
        // called 'keys' we'll use to store the history of what
        // keys the user has pressed.  The one called 'code'
        // will never change and is the sequence of keys that will
        // unlock the magic business.

          // keyEvent.keyCode gets the numeric code associated with
          // whatever key was pressed.
          // keys.push('blah') will add 'blah' to the array called 'keys'.

          // key onto the array, thus making the array bigger.
